		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Nishi Patel, a dedicated and adaptable Computer Science major currently attending California State
			University – Northridge. I am actively seeking a Software Engineer Intern role to apply my technical skills,
			gain real-world experience, and contribute to solving complex challenges. My goal is to continually grow as
			a software developer by embracing new technologies and expanding my problem-solving abilities.</p>

		<p>As a passionate student of computer science, I have developed a solid foundation in several programming
			languages, including Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in object-oriented programming
			(OOP) concepts and have a strong understanding of functional programming paradigms. Over the years, I have
			worked extensively with various programming languages and tools, and I am always eager to learn new ones to
			broaden my skill set.</p>

		<p>In addition to my programming expertise, I have a keen interest in web development. I am skilled in HTML5,
			CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular. I have gained practical experience in front-end
			development, building user-friendly and responsive websites and applications. My familiarity with web
			development enables me to create interactive, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.</p>

		<p>I also have a deep understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists, stacks,
			queues, trees, and graphs. My experience with sorting, searching, and hashing algorithms has given me the
			ability to approach problems analytically and optimize code for maximum efficiency. I am comfortable
			analyzing the time and space complexities of algorithms, ensuring that I implement the most efficient
			solution for each problem.</p>

		<p>In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle
			(SDLC). I am familiar with all stages of software development, including requirements analysis, design,
			coding, testing, and deployment. I have also worked with version control systems like Git, collaborating on
			team projects to build robust and scalable software solutions.</p>

		<p>One of the aspects I take pride in is my problem-solving and critical thinking ability. I enjoy approaching
			complex problems by breaking them down into manageable parts and developing creative solutions. My strong
			troubleshooting skills allow me to identify issues quickly and efficiently, ensuring smooth project
			execution. I am always motivated to learn, adapt, and tackle challenges head-on.</p>

		<p>Networking and security are also areas of interest to me. I have a solid understanding of computer networks,
			including TCP/IP protocols and network security principles. I am familiar with tools and techniques used for
			network troubleshooting and optimization, which enhances my ability to develop secure applications and
			protect data integrity.</p>

		<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been actively involved in group projects and collaborative efforts. I
			believe that effective communication and teamwork are essential for success in any field, and I continually
			work on improving my verbal and written communication skills. I enjoy collaborating with others to exchange
			ideas and find innovative solutions to problems.</p>

		<p>One of my notable projects, "Fastest Food Place Available," used Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree algorithm to
			determine the fastest food place to go to on campus based on crowd levels. This project was not only a great
			opportunity to apply algorithmic concepts but also provided me with practical experience in software
			development, data handling, and user experience design. It was a rewarding project that allowed me to
			contribute to making campus life more efficient for my fellow students.</p>

		<p>I am excited about the future of technology and software development and am eager to bring my skills,
			passion, and dedication to a software engineering internship. I look forward to the opportunity to work with
			innovative teams and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact.</p>
